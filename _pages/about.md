My journey to Computer Science
======
My academic journey is anything but conventional. As a freshman at **National Taiwan University (NTU)**, I excelled in my Chemical Engineering studies. However, I felt a disconnect between my natural aptitude for engineering and my passions for Computer Science. It was the magnetic pull of software and computing that truly kindled my intellectual curiosity.

Heeding this internal calling, I made a decisive move. I chose to **drop out** from NTU and ventured halfway across the world to the U.S. (And fortunately my parents are very open-minded and didn't beat me up for dropping out of college.) This decision led me to spend a year and a half honing my CS fundamental skills at **De Anza College** before transferring to Georgia Tech. 


Software Engineering
=====
As of now, I consider myself a **software engineer generalist**. I know a little about everything, raning from AI, Web3, full-stack development, to infrastructure development. However, I'm gradually shifting my focus towards **systems** and **infrastructure** development and get more involved with **ML systems research**.
